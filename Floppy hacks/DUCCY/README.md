# CHANGELOG

### V1
- Automatically replaces itself as "startup", calling on the old startup
- Allows you to set a timer inbetween each password injected

### V2
- Needs to be initiated by the user by pressing "Left Shift"
  - This means another user can use it without knowing it has DUCCY on it
  - Also means you can select a textfield before you start it (some login screens you have to click on the textfield)
