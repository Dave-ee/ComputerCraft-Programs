# CHANGELOG

### V1
- Automatically replaces itself as "startup", calling on the old startup
- Allows you to set a timer inbetween each password injected

### V2
- Needs to be initiated by the user by pressing "Left Shift"
  - This means another user can use it without knowing it has DUCCY on it
  - Also means you can select a textfield before you start it (some login screens you have to click on the textfield)

### V3 (Unreleased)
- Automatically copies all files on the computer to a floppy drive (if there is one and you tell it to)
- Options
  - Set key to start the injection (default: Left Shift)
  - Set DUCCY to replace startup (default: Off)
  - Set DUCCY to copy FS at runtime (default: Off)
  - Set DUCCY to inject one password per key press (default: Off)
  - Set DUCCY to ignore certain files/directories when copying FS
